# SQL Query & Logic Mastery Lab 🗄️

This repository is a showcase of advanced database querying capabilities. It moves beyond standard SQL to tackle **complex logic, data correlation, and high-performance analytical challenges.**

## 🧠 Featured: Advanced Problem-Solving Suite
The core of my SQL expertise is demonstrated through an intensive suite of **45+ complex analytical problems** (found in the `SQL-Queries` directory). These aren't just queries; they are logical puzzles solved using optimized SQL.
 
### 🛠️ Technical Depth & Complexity:
Instead of basic CRUD, this suite demonstrates mastery in:

* **Multi-Level Subqueries & Nesting:** Implementing deep nested logic to extract specific data points that require multiple stages of filtration (e.g., identifying extremes like Max/Min counts within aggregated sets).
* **Complex Relational Joins:** Seamlessly correlating data across multiple tables (Makes, Models, Details) to reconstruct complex business entities.
* **Advanced Data Aggregation:** Beyond simple `SUM` or `COUNT`, utilizing `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` with complex predicates to derive percentages, market shares, and production trends.
* **Conditional Logic & Formatting:** Using sophisticated filtering (`LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`) combined with logical operators to handle massive datasets with precision.

### 📈 Why this matters?
The queries implemented here prove the ability to:
1.  **Translate Complex Business Requirements** into efficient SQL code.
2.  **Handle High-Volume Data** by writing optimized queries that reduce execution overhead.
3.  **Perform Data Mining:** Extracting actionable insights from raw, unorganized relational data.
